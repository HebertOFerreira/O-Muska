Training what I'm learning in my course and college. 


I'm new, and I use for first time the concepts of bootstrap - I did not do these codes, like bootstrap.css or bootstrap.js, I get the file -download-, in the http://globocom.github.io/bootstrap/-. 

I know who I need learning more about JavaScript and Jquery, but I wanted to show how I'm  evolving over the time with HTML5 and CSS3.

I use Visual Studio Community 2015, because I'm student and get it for free. I like VS, he has nice tools, and direct download of codes and solutions who I need.
